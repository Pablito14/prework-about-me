      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a software developer in the Pacific Northwest area. First generation latino, with a passion for empowerment through technology, lets see what we can build together!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from in Auburn, Washington. A rough around the edges and everywhere else type of place.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Listening to music, video games, movies, experiences (food, cultures, walks in the park)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is something that allows me to live the life I want to. A job that allows me to travel, be paid well so that I can not worry about money. Something where I don't have to worry about my health from doing something hazerdous and where I can still make an impact. Something that ticks all those boxes for me was software developer, and since I've began this journey, I have only grown more excited to see where it leads.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the south Seattle area.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web dev because I want to evolve past that. I know web dev is the majority of software work in this era, but I want to push myself to learn these concepts and make something beyond that once I am capable. I want to see what I am capable of mostly.</p>
